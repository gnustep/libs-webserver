	* Internal.h:
	* WebServer.h:

	* WebServer.h:
	* Internal.h:
	* WebServer.m:
	* WebServerConnection.m:
	Implement a lockout mechanism to help deal with DoS attacks.
	The -[WebServerResponse block:] method can be used to block subsequent
	requests from an IP address for a period of time.
	The -[WebServer setBlockOnAuthenticationFailure:] method controls
	automatic blocking after a failed authentication attempt (default 1
	second).

2022-10-18 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServerConnection.m:
	Catch the possible case where we are configured to be behind a trusted

	Provide [-threadPool] accessor for the thread pool used by the web
	server instance.

2022-03-09 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServerConnection.m: Return 400 error if the request starts with
	a 0x16 byte ... that's not part of th method name and is probably the
	start of a TLS session header for handshake with the remote end trying
	to use HTTPS when the server is confgured to use HTTP.

2022-02-17 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Internal.h:
	* WebServer.h:
	* WebServer.m:
	* WebServerConnection.m:
	Changes when running behind a trusted proxy (if the WebServer instance
	is configured with Proxy=YES in the Secure dictionary, or has had the
	-setSecureProxy: called to say it is behind a proxy).
	Alter the behavior of the maximum connections per host limit so that
	we use the host information from the headers rather than the TCP/IP
	address of the connection.
	Similarly, if the host address from the headers is listed in the
	WebServerQuiet configuration, refrain from logging the connection.

2020-01-27 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Internal.h:
	* WebServer.h:
	* WebServer.m:

2019-01-08 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServer.m:
	* WebServerConnection.m:
	Ensure that x-cert-issuer and x-cert-owner headers passed in the
	incoming request are removed unless the process is configured to
	know that it is using a trusted proxy.  This prevents spoofing of
	client certificate information.  When configured to use a secure
	proxy, headers provided by the proxy take precedence and the values
	from the TLS session between the proxy and the server are provides
	in additional headers.

2018-08-24 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServer.h:
	* WebServerConnection.m:
	x-cert-issuer and x-cert-owner headers are set to provide the
	distinguished names of the issuer and owenr/subject of any client
	certificate used by an incoming request.

2017-04-19 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServerConnection.m:

	count when removing a connection from list of keepalives.
	Fixes a bug where connection keepalive would stop working after
	a while and all connections would be closed after one request.

2017-04-19 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	New WebServerFrameOptions user default (DENY if not set) to sert a
	default X-Frame-Options header value for use by all responses.

2016-10-28  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* WebServerBundles.m (-dealloc): Unregister from notification
	center.

	* Internal.h:
	Check to prevent a response being completed more than once.

2016-01-20 Niels Grewe <niels.grew@halbordnung.de>

	* WebServerHeader.m: Fix the x-count-* headers. The WSHType
	was never assigned to the instance variable, so -value
	would always return nil. Also re-arrange things to not 
	depend on the presence of the GSMimeHeader ivars, ensuring
	compatibility with the (pure) non-fragile ABI.

2016-01-15 Niels Grewe <niels.grew@halbordnung.de>

	* WebServer.h: Ensure that the header can be used from ARC
	  code.

2016-01-14 Niels Grewe <niels.grew@halbordnung.de>

	runtime library variants

2015-08-19 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServerConnection.m: Don't delete close down connections just

	with the client to keep those connections open.

2015-08-18 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServerConnection.m: Don't delete content-encoding header
	which may have been set by the application.

2014-10-02 Sergei Golovin

	* WebServer.m: Fix memory management error ... failure to retain
	the thread used for the main I/O ... was resulting in double
	release of the thread when the WebServer instance was destroyed.

2014-08-04 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServer.m: Run the main run loop and wait for connections to
	shut down when shutting down the server.
	* GNUmakefile: bump subminor version
	Version 1.5.3:

2014-07-15 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

2014-02-24 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServerConnection.m:
	* WebServer.h:
	* WebServer.m:
	* Internal.h:
	Added -setFooldHeaders: methods to turn off header folding either
	for a single response or for all connections established after the
	setting change.
	This is an improvement (bug#41643) to allow the WebServer code to
	be used to respond to clients which don't support folded lines as
	they should.
	NB. No longer fold headers by default ... more libraries support
	long headers than support folding.

2013-06-30 Sebastian Reitenbach <sebastia@l00-bugdead-prods.de>

	* testWebServer.m:
        Change to use WebServerRequest and WebServerResponse instances
        rather than GSMimeDocument ... so we can carry more information
        than a mime doucment.
        Add support for incremental handling of incoming requests, allowing
        the application to handle partially read requests (once the entre
        header has been read).

2012-10-25 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

        * Source/WebServer.m: Improve error logging for the case when a

        for text truncation due to nul byts, and log an NSData object
        (hexadecimal representation) after the native text representation.

2012-01-17 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServer.m: Fix bug with access control ... need to do it before
	main processing if we didn't do it in the pre-process stage.

2011-12-20 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* GNUmakefile: Version 1.4.7 minor release

	connection times out while waiting for ssl handshake.

2011-07-08 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	avoid running out of descriptors if hit by huge numbers of
	simultaneous requests.

2009-12-09 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* WebServer.m: Workaround for denial of service issues with HTTPS.
	An attacker could connect in and stop responding during the SSL
	handshake.  Because the handshake in gnustep-base has a 30 second
	timeout, this could have two nasty conserquences.
	Firstly the minor issue, if the connection idle timer was short
	enough (and the default is 30 seconds) the connection could time
	out before the handshaker completes.
	The major issue is that the code was not starting a new background
	accept until after the ssl handshake ... so the server would not
	be able to handle any new connections while the handshake was
	taking place.
	The solution is simply to schedule the next accept before performing
	the handshake for the current connection.

2009-09-24 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	to the first one).
